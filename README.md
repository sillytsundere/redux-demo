# Redux Tutorial

This repo's purpose was for me to follow along with a video tutorial that goes through Redux, Redux Toolkit and Redux React. 

The tutorial playlist can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwiaOAuTtVXittwybYIorRB3

Made by youtube account [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution)

I followed along with the 31 videos, taking notes and coding along with each video so I could familiarize myself with redux before applying it to my own project.
